Validator
=============

.. toctree::

After the end of each Era, the system will select a set of validators. In the subsequent Era, they will play a crucial role in highly sensitive protocols, such as block production and final verification. 
Their work demands a high standard, as they are required to perform costly operations, ensure high communication responsiveness, and build a reputation for long-term reliability. 
They must also stake their own tokens as a guarantee of good behavior; this stake will be penalized if they deviate from the protocol. 
Conversely, they will be rewarded for acting in accordance with the rules. 
Any node that completes its tasks can publicly become a candidate validator. 
However, due to operational considerations, only a limited number of validators can be selected in the end.
