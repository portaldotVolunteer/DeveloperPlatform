Nominator
=============

.. toctree::

The nominator publishes a list of candidate validators they trust and stakes a certain amount of tokens to support them. 
If some of these candidates are finally selected as validators, the nominator will receive corresponding profit rewards based on the proportion of their staked tokens. 
Unlike validators, there is no limit on the number of nominators. 
As long as the nominator makes selections and only supports candidate validators with sound security practices, their risk will be very low and they will have a steady source of income.
